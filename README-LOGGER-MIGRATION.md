# Logger Migration in SpurtCMS

## Overview

This document describes the migration from `fmt.Println` statements to structured logging using the `logger` package in SpurtCMS. The migration was performed to improve logging consistency, provide better error tracking, and enable log level filtering.

## Changes Made

1. **Replaced `fmt.Println` with Logger Calls**
   - All `fmt.Println` statements were replaced with appropriate logger calls
   - Log levels (Info, Error, Debug, Warn) were assigned based on the context
   - Error logs now include structured error information

2. **Fixed Import Paths**
   - Replaced relative imports (`./logger`, `../logger`, etc.) with module imports (`spurt-cms/logger`)
   - This ensures compatibility with Go modules and prevents build errors

## Scripts Created

Three scripts were created to automate the migration process:

1. **`scripts/find_fmt_prints.sh`**
   - Identifies all Go files containing `fmt.Println` statements
   - Outputs a list of files for processing

2. **`scripts/replace_fmt_prints.sh`**
   - Replaces `fmt.Println` statements with appropriate logger calls
   - Adds logger imports to files where needed
   - Handles different patterns of `fmt.Println` usage

3. **`scripts/fix_module_imports.sh`**
   - Replaces relative imports with proper module imports
   - Ensures compatibility with Go modules

## Benefits

1. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Errors are now logged with proper context using `logger.WithError(err)`
   - Error logs include file and line information

2. **Log Level Filtering**
   - Logs can be filtered by level (Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal)
   - Production environments can suppress Debug logs

3. **Structured Logging**
   - Additional context can be added to logs using structured fields
   - Makes logs more machine-readable for log aggregation systems

4. **Consistent Format**
   - All logs now follow a consistent format
   - Timestamps and log levels are included automatically

## Usage

See the `README-LOGGER.md` file for detailed information on how to use the logger package in your code.

## Docker Build Fix

The Docker build was failing with the error:
```
ERROR [8/9] RUN go build -o spurtcms .
graphql/controller/channels.go:14:2: local import "../../logger" in non-local package
controllers/categorycontroller.go:15:2: local import "../logger" in non-local package
debug-storage.go:8:2: local import "./logger" in non-local package
```

This was fixed by replacing all relative imports with module imports using the `fix_module_imports.sh` script.
